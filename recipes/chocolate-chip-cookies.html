<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chocolate chip cookies are a classic treat loved worldwide. First created in the 1930s by Ruth Wakefield, they feature a buttery dough filled with semi-sweet chocolate chips, balancing crisp edges with a soft centre. Over time, many variations have emerged, including versions with dark chocolate, nuts, or sea salt.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
    <li>Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your delicious chocolate chip cookies!</li>

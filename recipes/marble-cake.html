            <li>In a small bowl, combine cocoa powder and hot water to form a smooth paste. Add 1 cup of the cake batter to the cocoa mixture and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Layer the vanilla and chocolate batters in the prepared bundt pan, alternating between the two. Use a knife to create a marbled effect.</li>
